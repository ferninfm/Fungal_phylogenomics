abstract = {As techniques to sequence and map genomes and chromosomes improve, we should be able to learn more about our evolutionary history and what the genomes of our ancestors might have looked like. Three studies illustrate the potential of these approaches, comparing the genomes of 15 primate species with those of species from four non-primate orders to try and work out which are the ancestral mammalian genes.},

abstract = {Dense genetic maps of human, mouse, and rat genomes that are based on coding genes and on microsatellite and single-nucleotide polymorphism markers have been complemented by precise gene homolog alignment with moderate-resolution maps of livestock, companion animals, and additional mammal species. Comparative genetic assessment expands the utility of these maps in gene discovery, in functional genomics, and in tracking the evolutionary forces that sculpted the genome organization of modern mammalian species.},

@article{Sjolander2004,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Protein families evolve a multiplicity of functions through gene duplication, speciation and other processes. As a number of studies have shown, standard methods of protein function prediction produce systematic errors on these data. Phylogenomic analysis--combining phylogenetic tree construction, integration of experimental data and differentiation of orthologs and paralogs--has been proposed to address these errors and improve the accuracy of functional classification. The explicit integration of structure prediction and analysis in this framework, which we call structural phylogenomics, provides additional insights into protein superfamily evolution. RESULTS: Results of protein functional classification using phylogenomic analysis show fewer expected false positives overall than when pairwise methods of functional classification are employed. We present an overview of the motivations and fundamental principles of phylogenomic analysis, new methods developed for the key tasks, benchmark datasets for these tasks (when available) and suggest procedures to increase accuracy. We also discuss some of the methods used in the Celera Genomics high-throughput phylogenomic classification of the human genome. AVAILABILITY: Software tools from the Berkeley Phylogenomics Group are available at http://phylogenomics.berkeley.edu},
